Chris,
 
See the attached file.
 
# -- Equivalent to running the following query against the .dat files:
# --
# -- SELECT 'dul_it ' || u.name || '.' || o.name
# -- FROM USER$ u, OBJ$ o, TAB$ t
# -- WHERE u.user# = o.owner#
# -- AND o.obj# = t.obj#
# -- /
You can run this and it'll generate a long listing (every table for every user).  Some nice additions would be an exclusion list file, but for now you could just use grep to extract the ones you want.
